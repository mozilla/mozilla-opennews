<h2>Hack the News at the Mozilla Festival</h2>      
<p class="bodybig">In October, OpenNews will run the "Source Code for Journalism" track at the Mozilla Foundation's annual open-source learning and making extravaganza in London. MozFest is a hands-on conference where participants collaborate in 1-3 hour workshops designed to make it easy to think, prototype, hack, and build together. At the end of the weekend, participants have new ideas, new relationships, and new items in their tool kit to bring back to their newsroom or open source community.</p>
 
<p>Come hack the news: learn, teach, and make journalism that's native to the open web. <a href="http://sessions.mozillafestival.org/">Propose a session</a> by August 31 or <a href="http://mzl.la/mozfest13-register">register to attend</a> the Festival in London, October 25-27.</p>

<h3>What is OpenNews?</h3>
<p>OpenNews is a collaboration between the Knight Foundation and Mozilla that's dedicated to building an ecosystem to help journalism thrive on the open web. It's about producing next-generation web solutions that solve real problems in news. It's about supporting communities of developers and journalists as they make, learn, and invent together. And it's about deploying <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/fellowships">fellows</a>—and code—into news organizations to collaborate and innovate in new ways.</p>

      <h3>Fellowships</h3>
      <p>Knight-Mozilla Fellows spend 10 months embedded in partner newsrooms. They are <a href="/fellowships/info.html">paid</a> to work with the community inside and outside of their newsroom to develop and share open-source projects that help to transform journalism on the web. <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/fellowships">Learn more.</a>
</p>

<h3>Code Sprints</h3>
<p>OpenNews <a href="/codesprints.html">Code Sprints</a> are for developers that want to make small, open-source tools that fill real-world needs in newsrooms around the globe. Through Code Sprints, we've helped fund data visualization tools, election data parsers, civic data scrapers, and more. <a href="/codesprints.html">Here's how.</a></p>

      <h3>Hack days</h3>
      <p>We sponsor hack days across the globe to write code and build community and momentum around creating technical solutions to problems that working journalists face. <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/hackdays.html">Start hacking.</a>
</p>
      <h3>Source</h3>
      <p>We run <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/">Source</a> as a centerpoint for the code being written throughout the journalism community. From features that give the context behind the code, to an index of the community making it, Source is dedicated to capturing the people and projects behind journalism code. <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/">Visit now.</a></p>
      
      <h3>Community</h3>
      <p>The hacker-journalist community is a vibrant one, and all our initiatives are designed to help it grow in size as well as strength. A diverse array of skills and experiences in technology are necessary to tackle the challenges facing journalism, and we're excited about bringing new people into this community. We want to engage the community at every step, that means we need your help. <a href="http://mozillaopennews.org/getinvolved.html">Get involved.</a>
