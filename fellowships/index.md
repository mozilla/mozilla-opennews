Fellows work in the open by sharing their code and their discoveries, helping to strengthen and build journalism's toolbox.</p>

[Apply now to become a 2014 Fellow.](http://mozillaopennews.org/fellowships/apply.html)

###Be Embedded in the Newsroom
Knight-Mozilla Fellows experience the day-to-day energy of some of the best newsrooms in the world: being present as news breaks, writing code for the day’s headlines, wrangling thorny datasets, and taking a step back to solve real-world journalistic problems. Our Fellows' work is rooted in developing projects that help us better understand our world. 

###Work in the Open
Knight-Mozilla Fellows share the work they're doing with the world outside of the newsroom. By blogging their experiences, pushing code to open repositories, taking part in the OpenNews [community calls](https://wiki.mozilla.org/OpenNews/Calls), and engaging with other developers, our Fellows are helping to spread the code they're making and strengthen the journalism-developer community. And given that news is such a large part of the web, the open work of the Fellows contributes to a more transparent, open, and accessible web.
