###The 2015 Fellowships
Seven news organizations around the world will host our Knight-Mozilla Fellows in 2015: the Guardian, La Nacion, NPR, Vox Media, the Center for Investigative Reporting, the New York Times, and the Washington Post.

###The Fellowship Experience
Knight-Mozilla Fellows work in some of the best newsrooms in the world: they're present as news breaks, write code for the day’s headlines, wrangle thorny datasets, and get to take a step back to build better newsroom tools and practices. As a Fellow, you would live and work for 10 months in the city where your host newsroom is located (relocation is supplemented as part of the Fellowship) and work as a member of the newsroom team.

The kinds of projects Fellows work on day-to-day are dictated by the news organization and the Fellow, and include projects focused on data, mapping, research, and impact analysis. If you already have ideas of things that interest you, whether it be news games or civic data crunching, that’s great. We’re looking for people who want to experiment with technology in journalism, and Fellows get plentiful room to figure out what those experiments should be.

###Why Newsrooms?
Our Fellows' work is rooted in developing open projects that help us all better understand our world via journalism. But embedding Fellows in newsrooms does more than contributing to journalism.

News is at the center of many people’s web use, and the technology decisions news organizations are currently making will shape the way we experience the entire web for years to come. As advocates of the open web, we are especially invested in making open technology options a realistic and attractive option for newsrooms, technically and culturally.

###Working in the Open
Knight-Mozilla Fellows share their work beyond their host newsrooms. By blogging their experiences, pushing code to open repositories, and taking part in other OpenNews initiatives, our Fellows help strengthen the entire journalism-developer community and contribute to a more transparent, secure, and accessible internet.
