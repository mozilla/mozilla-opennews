** What is a "fellow" anyway? **

When we say "fellow" we don't mean "man." A fellow is someone who "shares a particular activity, quality, or condition with someone." Fellowship programs bring together a diverse collection of people with shared skills and experiences to spend time and collaborate together.

** What skills and experience are you looking for in a Knight-Mozilla Fellow?**

The <a href="/fellowships">Knight-Mozilla Fellowship</a> program is designed specifically to engage developers, hackers, engineers, technologists, data crunchers, and other people who like to code and bring them into the newsroom as Fellows. Fellows have come from a variety of backgrounds including academia, software engineering, open source coding, and newsroom development.

** I only know [insert programming language here] or only have [back end/front end/design/mapping/data] development experience, should I still apply?**

Absolutely! There is no requirement for a particular programming language or development skillset. A lot of news app development happens in front end, especially mapping and visualization, and people with those skills are highly sought after. Statistics, data, and even hard math skills are also great. If you have built something with code and you're curious about the Fellowship, <a href="/fellowships/apply.html">apply</a>.

** What type of applicants are you looking for? **

If you have a knack for coding and an interest in contributing your skills to journalistic projects, <a href="/fellowships/apply.html">you should apply</a>. There is no "typical" Fellow. Most of our Fellows did not major in Computer Science. Many of our Fellows never visited a newsroom before their Fellowship. 

We are an inclusive program and seek Fellows that reflect the diversity of the communities we serve. Women and other under-represented participants in technology are strongly encouraged to <a href="/fellowships/apply.html">apply for a Knight-Mozilla Fellowship</a>.

** I don't speak English very well or live in the U.S. Can I still participate?**

We are an international program (our six news partners cover three continents) and welcome participants from around the world. You do not need to be a U.S. citizen to participate in the program. We <a href="/fellowships/info.html">assist</a> Fellows with any necessary visa applications for working and traveling during the Fellowship. Perfect English is not a requirement, however please be aware that it may be challenging to participate in some aspects of our program if your English is limited.

** Where will the fellows be based? How are the fellows matched with news organizations?**

Fellows are based, unless special circumstances dictate, in the town of their host news organization. 

In 2014, the Fellows will be based with:

* [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com)
* [ProPublica](http://www.propublica.org) in New York
* [The Texas Tribune](http://www.texastribune.org) in Austin, Texas
* [La Nacion](http://www.lanacion.com.ar/) in Buenos Aires
* and a joint fellowship with [Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com) and [Internews Kenya](http://www.internewskenya.org/dataportal/)

We make every attempt to match skills of Fellows with needs of news organizations when matching Fellow to organization.

** What do I need to do to apply? **

The application is designed to be quick: Just a quick five question application, plus some links to stuff you've made. There are no recommendations to hunt down and no trick questions. <a href="/fellowships/apply.html">Apply now.</a>

** What are you looking for with the example projects on the application? **

We want to see three projects that you are proud of. Tell us why you're excited about the project, and if you made the project has part of a team, describe the contribution that you made. The examples you include are not shared beyond the small pool of application reviewers.

** What is the timeline after the Fellowship deadline closes?**

The <a href="/fellowships/apply.html">Fellowship application</a> opened on June 17 and closes August 17, 2013. After August 17, all applications will be reviewed by a small reviewing panel. By early September, a final batch of 20-30 semifinalists will be selected and interviews conducted. Finalists will be notified by early October and a public announcement of our 2014 fellows will be made at the Mozilla Festival in London October 25, 2013.

** What kind of competition are you expecting with the Fellowship?**

This is the third year of the Fellowship search process. The first year had a very different model, so last year is the best and only real comparison. Last year we had 165 applications for eight Fellowship positions. This year we have five Fellowships available. As the application is still open and given that many people apply at the last minute, it's hard to put a number on how many applicants we'll have this year. One thing that seems different from last year is that the total number of *qualified* applicants is larger. We've already received applications from several skilled programmers, and civic data enthusiasts in particular. 

In terms of the applicant pool, what has remained consistent each year is that we are committed to matching the skills of the Fellow to the needs of the news organization. It's a very individualized matching process.

** How does the application review and matching process work? ** 

Applications are submitted through a Blue State Digital form and are visible at the time they are submitted, but formal review does not begin until after the application deadline closes on August 17.

* OpenNews staff (Dan Sinker and Erika Owens) review all of the applications and cull the batch to a manageable number for the news partners to review.
* The news partners review this shorter list and submit a list of the five people they are most interested in learning more about.
* These semifinalists are contacted for interviews. Applicants who are not moving forward in the selection process are notified.
* Dan and Erika conduct short, standardized interviews with the semifinalists, asking a few questions that are about vision and skills/practical considerations.
* The notes from these interviews are submitted back to the news partners for review, and the news partners are able to pick their top three finalists from the entire pool of semifinalists, not just the five they initially submitted. (Last year there was a lot of crossover at this stage.)
* The semifinalists that are not moving forward are notified of their application status.
* The news organization and OpenNews has a much longer interview with each of that news organization's top three candidates with more detailed questions about the semifinalist's fit with the news partner. This is also a chance for the semifinalist to learn more about the news partner. 
* After those interviews, the news organization selects their top two potential Fellows.
* In consultation with OpenNews and the news partners, the final Fellow selection is made for each news organization.
* The selected Fellows are notified and given an opportunity to ask additional questions of the news partner and OpenNews.
* The finalists that were not selected as Fellows are notified of their application status.
* A public announcement of the Fellows is made at the Mozilla Festival.

** What is the timeline for the Fellowship?**

2014 Fellowships begin in calendar year 2014 and last for 10 months. Each fellows' start date will be individualized for the needs of that fellow and the news organization, but generally fellowships will begin in Jan/Feb 2014.

** What type of projects do the fellows work on?**

That is dictated by the news organization and the Fellow. Fellows work on a range of projects including data, mapping, research, and analysis of impact. If you already have ideas of things that interest you, whether it be news games or civic data crunching, that's great. We're looking for talented people who want to experiment with technology in journalism. In collaboration with OpenNews, the other Fellows, and your news organization Fellows get a lot of room to figure out what those experiments will be.

** I'm still on the fence about applying.**

You should apply. As <a href="https://twitter.com/jmm">Miranda Mulligan</a> said during a <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/opennews-calls-June26">Q&A</a> about the Fellowship: "Applying is not making a decision to do [the fellowship] and getting an offer does not mean you have to take an offer!" If you have experience with code and an interest in journalism and you're curious about applying, do so. As current Fellow <a href="https://twitter.com/veltman">Noah Veltman</a> pointed out, many people who are now Fellows thought their application was a long shot. <a href="/fellowships/apply.html">Apply today</a>. 

** Are you still accepting applications for host newsrooms?**

No, we are not accepting host newsroom applications at this time.

** Why is Mozilla interested in media and journalism?**

The news industry is a major player in the web space, and it is at a crossroads. Many news organizations are making important web technology decisions and investments that will shape how we experience the web for years to come. We want to provide news organizations with open technology options as they make those decisions. 

Because news is at the center of many people's web use, this is an opportunity to reach a huge population with Mozilla's open web values and working with open technology. Technology that was created in news organizations, like [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), is shaping the web beyond journalism as well.

** What is the Knight Foundation?**

The [John S. and James L. Knight Foundation](http://knightfoundation.org) advances journalism in the digital age and invests in the vitality of communities where the Knight brothers owned newspapers. Knight Foundation focuses on projects that promote informed and engaged communities and lead to transformational change.
