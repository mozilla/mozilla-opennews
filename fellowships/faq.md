** What is a "fellow" anyway? **

A fellow is someone who "shares a particular activity, quality, or condition with someone." Fellowship programs bring together men and women with shared skills and experiences to spend time and collaborate together.

** What skills and experience are you looking for in a Knight-Mozilla Fellow?**

The Knight-Mozilla Fellowship program is designed specifically to engage developers, hackers, engineers, technologists, data crunchers, and other people who like to code and bring them into the newsroom as Fellows. Fellows have come from a variety of backgrounds including academia, software engineering, open source coding, and newsroom development.

** What type of applicants are you looking for? **

If you have a knack for coding and an interest in contributing your skills to journalistic projects, you should apply. There is no "typical" Fellow. Most of our Fellows did not major in Computer Science. Many of our Fellows never visited a newsroom before their Fellowship. 

We are an inclusive program and seek Fellows that reflect the diversity of the communities we serve. Women and other under-represented participants in technology are strongly encouraged to apply for a Knight-Mozilla Fellowship.

** I don't speak English very well or live in the U.S. Can I still participate?**

We are an international program (our six news partners cover three continents) and welcome participants from around the world. You do not need to be a U.S. citizen to participate in the program. We assist Fellows with any necessary visa applications for working and traveling during the Fellowship. Perfect English is not a requirement, however please be aware that it may be challenging to participate in some aspects of our program if your English is limited.

We strive for OpenNews to be an international program. Our six news partners cover three continents.

** Where will the fellows be based? How are the fellows matched with news organizations?**

Fellows are based, unless special circumstances dictate, in the town of their host news organization. 

In 2014, the Fellows will be based with:

* [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com)
* [ProPublica](http://www.propublica.com) in New York
* [The Texas Tribune](http://www.texastribune.com) in Austin, Texas
* [La Nacion](http://www.lanacion.com.ar/) in Buenos Aires
* and a joint fellowship with [Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com) and [Internews Kenya](http://www.internewskenya.org/dataportal/)

We make every attempt to match skills of Fellows with needs of news organizations when matching Fellow to organization.

** What happens after the Fellowship deadline closes?**

After August 17, 2013 all applications will be reviewed by a small reviewing panel. By early September, a final batch of 20-30 semifinalists will be selected and interviews conducted. Finalists will be notified by early October and a public announcement of our 2014 fellows will be made at the Mozilla Festival in London October 25, 2013.

** What is the timeline for the Fellowship?**

2014 Fellowships begin in calendar year 2014 and last for 10 months. Each fellows' start date will be individualized for the needs of that fellow and the news organization, but generally fellowships will begin in Jan/Feb 2014.

** Are you still accepting applications for host newsrooms?**

No, we are not accepting host newsroom applications at this time.

** Why is Mozilla interested in media and journalism?**

The news industry is a major player in the web space, and it is at a crossroads. Many news organizations are making important web technology decisions and investments that will shape how we experience the web for years to come. We want to provide news organizations with open technology options as they make those decisions. 

Because news is at the center of many people's web use, this is an opportunity to reach a huge population with Mozilla's open web values and working with open technology. Technology that was created in news organizations, like [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), is shaping the web beyond journalism as well.

** What is the Knight Foundation?**

The [John S. and James L. Knight Foundation](http://knightfoundation.org) advances journalism in the digital age and invests in the vitality of communities where the Knight brothers owned newspapers. Knight Foundation focuses on projects that promote informed and engaged communities and lead to transformational change.
