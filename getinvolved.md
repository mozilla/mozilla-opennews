<h3>Build With Us</h3>
We're helping to sponsor journalism-themed hack days around the world this year, and would love for you to take part.
<ul> 
<li>We're actively <a href="https://donate.mozilla.org/page/s/knight-mozilla-news-hack-day">looking for partners to host hack days</a>, so let us know what you're up to. 
<li>If you're a developer who wants to hack with us, check our <a href="/hackdays.html">hack day page</a> to find out what's happening near you.

<h3>Contribute to Source</h3>
<a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org">Source</a> is our site dedicated to journalism code and the community around it. We run regular features delving deeply into news code, as well as work to index all of the code that's out there in the journalism space. We can't do it without your help.
<ul>
<li>If you're writing code in the journalism space and want to document your work for Source, or if you're a writer that wants to help document others' work, we want to <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/contribute/">hear from you</a>.
<li>If you're a coder who wants their open code listed in the <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/code">Source Code Index</a>, <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/contribute/">submit to get it listed</a>.
</ul>
