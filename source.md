<p class="bodybig">The code being written in journalism is driving innovation across the web, and the community writing it is talented, vibrant, and growing. <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org">Source</a> is dedicated to spotlighting that community and diving deep into the code it's making.</p>
<h3>Revealing the context around the code</h3>
Code isn't written in a vacuum. That's true for any line of code that's been written, and it's especially true in journalism, where the news of the day influences the lines of code written to report it. <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/articles/">Our features</a> connect the code with its context, using the journalistic approach of "Who, What, Why, When, and How" to exploring the motivations, ideas, and innovations behind the lines of code.
<h3>Chronicling the community that writes it</h3>
We've built the journalism-code community into the very <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/source/">source code</a> of Source itself, collecting data around <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/people">people</a> and <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/organizations">organizations</a> with every article we write and every line of code we index. As a result, you're able to learn more about the creators of journalism's vital codebases right alongside the code they've written.
<h3>Helping you to learn it</h3>
<a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/learning">OpenNews Learning</a> calls Source its home. Offering regularly updated case studies that look into data crunching, visualizations, mapping, and the ethics of journalism in the digital age <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/learning">OpenNews Learning</a> offers in-depth, behind-the-scenes, guides to the exciting world of journalism code written by the very people that make it.
<h3>Helping you to find it</h3>
The <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/code/">Source Code Index</a> is perhaps the site's most useful feature: An index to the open code being written in journalism, fully tagged and searchable. Need to find <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/search/?q=ruby+mapping">Ruby mapping libraries</a>? Want to see everything in Source's index <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/search/?q=New+York+Times">by the New York Times</a>? Source lets you find it, from any page on the site. Want to browse? Source <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/code/">collects all our code entries</a> in one simple place and lets you drill down from there.
<h3>We need you too</h3>
Are you a developer with some open repositories of journalism code you'd like us to index? Or maybe you're a writer wanting to help chronicle the innovations happening in journalism. Either way, we need you to help make Source even better. So please, <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/contribute/">contribute to Source</a>.
