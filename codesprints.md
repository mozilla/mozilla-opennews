At OpenNews, we want to help build great tools to do journalism, and we want those tools to be open-sourced and freely available to everyone. But we know  that some of the most useful tools are the simplest and so we've created Code Sprint Grants to assist in creating some of those simple tools for journalism.
</p>
<h3>Small Tools with Big Impact</h3>
<p>We think that tools are built best when they're rooted in real needs, so we're partnering with news organizations from around the world to write great code forged from the daily demands of the newsroom. We're looking to help create small tools that make big impacts, tools like:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop">Tabletop.js</a>: Easier display of spreadsheet data
<li><a href="http://propublica.github.com/timeline-setter/">Timelinesetter</a>: Easier timelines
<li><a href="http://misoproject.com/dataset/">Dataset</a>: Easier management of data for visualization
</ul>

<h3>How it Works</h3>
<ul>
<li>Code Sprint Grants are for $10,000 to fund small-scale utilities and tools that help solve specific, repeatable journalistic problems.
<li>News organizations collaborate with OpenNews to define Code Sprint projects, outline their technical needs, and find the right person to write the code.
<li>The news organization is the project lead and should be able to both project-manage the development and shepherd the continued  life of the open-sourced code.
<li>OpenNews pays the coder (or team) and stays involved in the development process.
<li>All Code Sprint Grant-funded code is documented and open-sourced on completion.
</ul>
