### [Find a Job in a Newsroom](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/jobs/)
News organizations are hungry for skilled developers and data wranglers who want to do journalism development, data-wrangling, and visualization work full time—and many of the positions are open even to those with no prior newsroom experience. <a href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/jobs/">Find a journalism code job at Source Jobs</a>.

### [Share Your Work on Source](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/contribute/)

From visualization libraries to data extractors and presentation templates, newsrooms are creating some of the most exciting code on the internet right now. We highlight that work on [Source](http://source.opennews.org), our community site focused on the behind-the-scenes work of newsroom code. On Source, news developers share the code, process, and thinking underlying news applications and interactives. The resources on the site are a direct result of the generosity of the developers, designers, and newsrooms who are willing to share their work. Join them by [sharing your contributions](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/contribute/) today.
