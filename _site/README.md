## Knight-Mozilla OpenNews ##
This is the current site for the [Knight-Mozilla OpenNews project](http://www.mozillaopennews.org "Knight-Mozilla OpenNews project"). 

Knight-Mozilla OpenNews is about building an ecosystem to help journalism thrive on the open web. It's about producing next-generation web solutions that solve real problems in news. It's about supporting communities of developers and journalists as they make, learn and invent together. And it's about deploying fellows—and code—into news organizations to collaborate and innovate in new ways.
