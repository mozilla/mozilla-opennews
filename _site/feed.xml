<title>Captioning a Multi-Track Conference - How SRCCON Did It</title>
<dc:creator></dc:creator>

<description>One of the nerdiest elements of our first SRCCON didn't end up involving code or jokey references. As we were prepping for SRCCON last year, I caught a blog post related to !!Con, &lt;a href=&quot;http://composition.al/blog/2014/05/31/your-next-conference-should-have-real-time-captioning/&quot;&gt;Your next conference should have real-time captioning&lt;/a&gt;. I had never heard of event captioning before. I found the blog post convincing, but we were less than two months away from SRCCON, could we pull off something like this?</description>
