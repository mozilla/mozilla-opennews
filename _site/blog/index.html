      <p class="excerpt">Live from the 2014 Mozilla Festival in London, we're thrilled to introduce our 2015 Knight-Mozilla Fellows. The work that the Knight-Mozilla Fellows do during their fellowship year doesn't fit easily into a single sentence. Over the year a fellow will play the role of coder, teacher, mentor (and mentee), adventurer, colleague, and friend. They'll push themselves, and journalism, in new directions. They'll do work that has real impact--on themselves and on the web. It's a tall order, but a thrilling one, and the people we have lined up to do the work of a Knight-Mozilla Fellow in 2015 are among our very best yet. I can't wait for you to meet them.&nbsp;<a href="/blog/announcing-2015-fellows">read more</a>
