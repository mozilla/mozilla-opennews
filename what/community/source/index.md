<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p class="bodybig">The code emerging from newsrooms drives innovation across the web, and the community writing it is talented, dedicated, and growing fast. Our community hub, <a href="http://source.opennews.org">Source</a> is spotlights that community and dives deep into the code it&#8217;s making.</p>

### The Context Behind the Code

No code is written in a vacuum, and that&#8217;s especially true in journalism, where the news of the day influences the lines of code written to research, report, and interpret it. <a href="http://source.opennews.org/articles/">Our features</a> connect the code with its context, using the journalistic approach of "Who, What, Why, When, and How" to exploring the motivations, ideas, and innovations behind the lines of code.

We've built the shape of the community into the very <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/source/">source code</a> of Source itself, collecting data around <a href="http://source.opennews.org/people">people</a> and <a href="http://source.opennews.org/organizations">organizations</a> with every article we write and every line of code we index. You can learn more about the creators of journalism's vital codebases right alongside the code they've written.
