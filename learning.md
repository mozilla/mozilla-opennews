At the core of the Knight-Mozilla OpenNews project is a desire to pull back the curtain on how code is made in journalism so that more developers can get involved. <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/learning/">OpenNews Learning</a> takes that desire and places it straight into our <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/">Source</a> project.

<h3>Making the Invisible Visible</h3>
<p><a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/learning/">OpenNews Learning</a> is built on case studies around the journalistic problemsets that developers come across in the newsroom. From diving deep into data crunching, looking into the visualizations and presentations possible in news, getting up to speed on the many ways of mapping information, and a look at the ethics of journalism in the digital age, OpenNews Learning offers in-depth, behind-the-scenes, guides to the exciting world of journalism code.

<h3>A team of expert guides</h3>
